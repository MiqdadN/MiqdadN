# 👋 Hi, I'm Miqdad Naduthodi

🎮 **Researcher | Game Developer | Visualization Specialist**  
📍 M.S. in Visualization — Texas A&M University  
🔬 Exploring the intersection of **AI, Game Design, and Interactive Simulations**

---

### 🧠 About Me
I build systems where **games meet research** — combining player behavior, AI, and data visualization.  
My work spans **game balance analysis**, **digital twins**, and **cultural environment design**, using Unity, Unreal Engine, and Python for research-driven experimentation.

### 🚀 Research & Projects

#### 🎮 [Game Balance Evaluation for Asymmetric Fighter Games](#)
A hybrid framework for evaluating fairness in asymmetric fighting games through **manual playtesting and AI-driven simulation**.  
Developed in Unity with data analytics to assess **win-rate balance, matchup dynamics, and performance metrics**.

#### 🏫 [Digital Twin of Langford C’s 4th Floor](#)
An Unreal Engine-based **real-time simulation** of student movement and space usage at Texas A&M University.  
Integrates **MQTT data streams**, AI agents, and interactive visualization for **occupancy and behavior analysis**.

#### 🏺 [Ancient South Indian Civilization – Environmental Study](#)
An Unreal Engine **environmental reconstruction** inspired by the **Sangam Era (~100 AD)**.  
Combines historical research and artistic design to recreate ancient **architecture, culture, and lifestyle** through 3D assets and world-building.

#### 🎵 [Generation of Musical Notations from Instrumental Audio](#)
Undergraduate thesis on **signal processing and machine learning** to translate piano sounds into **musical notation**.  
Implements frequency analysis and classification (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression) to identify notes from monophonic audio.
